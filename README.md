# Emily Weagraff Professional Portfolio Page

## Description:

The following is the beginning of my professional portfolio page. I utilized the skills that I have learned from HTML and CSS to create my portfolio page. The projects section will eventually carry links to real projects I have worked on. I will continue to add to and update my page as I progress in the course so that I am employer ready and competitive by the end.
